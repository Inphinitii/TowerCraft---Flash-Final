## Gameplay
TowerCraft is a tower defense game that incorporates crafting into the core of its gameplay. 
Enemies that die to your basic towers will drop certain crafting reagants used to upgrade your towers.

Ie; Flame + Arrow = Flaming Arrow Tower. 

The user must craft each tower that they plan on placing either ahead of time or right when they need it.

## Involvement
My involvement in TowerCraft was primarily to provide the graphics, tile system, and user interface.
I also assisted in the path finding, projectile, and enemy logic. 

##Restrictions
Currently only one tower type is implemented, the fire arrow tower.
This was all that was necessary for this project to get a finished status.
Uses XML to determine what items can be combined into what, so it's relatively easy to expand.
