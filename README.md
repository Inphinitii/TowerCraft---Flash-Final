## Gameplay
TowerCraft is a tower defense game that incorporates crafting into the core of its gameplay. 
Enemies that die to your basic towers will drop certain crafting reagants used to upgrade your towers.

Ie; Flame + Arrow = Flaming Arrow Tower. 

The user must craft each tower that they plan on placing either ahead of time or right when they need it.

## Involvement
- All tile and tower art, as well as the user interface artwork
- Tile map
- User Interface - Main Menu / Inventory(Bag) / Crafting Menu
- Path finding (Node based)
- Projectile logic
- Enemy logic

##Restrictions
Currently only two tower types are implemented: the fire arrow tower and cannon tower.
This was all that was necessary for this project to get a finished status.
Uses XML to determine what items can be combined into what, so it's relatively easy to expand.
